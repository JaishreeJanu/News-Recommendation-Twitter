      "Mithun breathes promise into Karnataka's Ranji aspirations\n",
      "\n",
      "• Last updated on Sun, 12 Nov, 2017, 07:03 PM Akshay Maanay in Alur\n",
      "\n",
      "Abhimanyu Mithun picked up four wickets in a six-over spell to help Karnataka gain a crucial first-innings lead. © Getty\n",
      "\n",
      "Abhimanyu Mithun's hands pointed skywards and the head fell back in relief after he scalped Delhi's last wicket - Kulwant Khejroliya. The right-arm pacer had picked up a five-fer for the second time this season, making this his best start to a Ranji season since Karnataka's eventful season in 2014-15.\n",
      "\n",
      "He and Vinay Kumar have shouldered Karnataka's fast bowling responsibilities since he made his debut in 2009-10. The duo have now formed a famed partnership around which the state's other fast bowlers revolve. Though Mithun is more injury prone than his skipper, but when fit, he is a vital cog in the Karnataka team and that was on display when he accumulated 80 wickets across two title-winning campaigns.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last two years have seen Mithun in and out of the side, sometimes due to injury and on other occasions due to lack of form. However, he started this season with hopes of making a comeback to the national team, and the journey so far has been on track. The five-fer in the second innings against Maharashtra set the tone for Mithun and he carried that rhythm into the Delhi game too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Last year things didn't go well for me. So many things didn't go our way and I was really upset about that. Coming into this season, I was really prepared for that. We also have new coaches and they gave me the confidence to go out and express myself. They support me really well. Even before the start of the season, they gave me confidence during the Dr. K. Thimmappiah Memorial Tournament and even in the KPL I got into a good rhythm.I had the confidence in me and a lot of things have changed since last season and that has helped me tremendously,\" Mithun said after the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a batting paradise in Alur, where batsmen enjoyed racking up the runs, Mithun was one bowler who extracted something out of it, especially during the post-lunch session on Day 3 and the morning session of Day 4. He rattled the set duo of Gautam Gambhir and Dhruv Shorey before going past the former's defenses. The next day when Karnataka needed an extraordinary effort to bowl Delhi out, Mithun produced that spell in which he accounted for four batsmen for 14 runs in the six overs he bowled. In the process, he gave Karnataka the crucial first-innings lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yesterday we bowled and we saw how the batsmen played. There was nothing on the wicket and we believed that if we put in the effort we could make something out on this wicket. I just went and bowled my heart out and I got the results,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mithun was breathing fire, his partner and skipper - Vinay - kept things tight at the other end. One of the major reasons for their success as a pair is because they complement each other. The two strike the right balance with their knowledge of when to hold back and when to go for the kill, and their 28 wickets this season is why Karnataka find themselves at the top of the points table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is making the batsmen play more. It is important for an inswing bowler to make the batsman play and from there even if the ball straightens, there are more chances for him to get wickets. He is more consistent and mature. Overall, he is growing as a cricketer and it is good for the team,\" Vinay pointed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Karnataka's new-ball combo has played many a role in recent years, especially during their all-conquering 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons. The challenges remain the same with the duo tasked with the responsibility of spearheading the attack once more, as they aim to reach the pinnacle again.\n",
